              Keyboarding class is a whole class period when you go on typing websites and try to get your WPM up, when you're done practicing you take a test
              try to beat your last test score. when you first enter the class you grab a book, and go on word and type what section you're on. you also practice
              the right way to sit while typing, and to not look at the keyboard. (by Bently Alberts)

            <p class="mediumText">I started teaching in 1989.  I took a 10 year hiatus to run my own business. I returned to teaching and have taught Jr. High for the last 13 years. I teach Digital Literacy and College and Career Awareness. WOW, two subjects that can really make a difference in my students quality of life and decisions for the future. I get to work with Jr. High students and get paid for it. Awesome.</p>
            <p class="mediumText">Digital Literacy can help you now and into the future.</p>
            <p class="mediumText">College and Career Awareness gives my students a direction if not the actual destination for their education and employment.</p>
