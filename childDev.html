Child Development is a class in which students learn about the proper things needed for a child to properly develop. This class is taught by Robyn Mosher. One of the main projects you will encounter in this class is taking home a robotic baby that you have to feed, burp, rock, and change it's diaper. This programe will simulate what it's like to have a baby. The baby will cry at any time, whether it's day or night.
In this class you will also do projects for a developing child. Shape and color matching, emotion finding, etc.
