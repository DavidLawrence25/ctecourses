    <h2>What is CTE?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Career & Technical Education (CTE)</strong> is a subject offered here at Sunset,
        preparing the future generations for occupations involving strong command of technology.
        The field is growing rapidly, and we must fuel the flame by teaching all interested the
        essentials to fulfill their dreams. CTE includes most computer science, woodshop, and Family
        & Consumer Science courses.

            <p>In 2012 I graduated from Weber State University with a Bachelor's Degree in History and Spanish Teaching. I was hired in Fall 2012 to teach part-time Utah and U.S. History at Sunset Jr. High, the Jr. High I attended as a Jr. High student. I taught one year part-time and was then offered a full-time position at the end of my first year. In July 2013 I went back to school to earn my Master's Degree in Education. I earned my Master's Degree in July 2014 from Concordia University, Portland. I have 3 wonderful children who are the highlight of my life. The 2022 school year will be my 10th year at Sunset Jr. High.</p>
            <p>I was asked to start teaching a Coding class at the Jr. High. After taking several classes and attending several conferences I found an amazing curriculum created by Apple called "Everyone Can Code." In August 2020 I started to work on another Bachelor's Degree at Western Governors University. This time I am working on earning a degree in Computer Science. In the Sprint of 2017, I started coaching the Girls and Boys Golf Teams at Northridge High and have loved every minute of it. I also have a second job that I started in October 2019 at the Apple Store at Farmington Station.</p>
            <p>Life is busy but I love every minute of it!</p>

            <p class="mediumText">I started teaching in 1989.  I took a 10 year hiatus to run my own business. I returned to teaching and have taught Jr. High for the last 13 years. I teach Digital Literacy and College and Career Awareness. WOW, two subjects that can really make a difference in my students quality of life and decisions for the future. I get to work with Jr. High students and get paid for it. Awesome.</p>
            <p class="mediumText">Digital Literacy can help you now and into the future.</p>
            <p class="mediumText">College and Career Awareness gives my students a direction if not the actual destination for their education and employment.</p>
