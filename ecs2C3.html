    <h2>What is Expl. CS2 - Coding 3?</h2>
      <p>
        As a continuation of ECS2 - Coding 2, this will extend your knowledge of the subjects and techniques taught in your previous venture. The levels ingame will be a little trickier to navigate than usual, 
        and the loops may take a bit more thought. At the end of this course, you should be capable of solving complex programming challenges one might face in the real world.

            <p>In 2012 I graduated from Weber State University with a Bachelor's Degree in History and Spanish Teaching. I was hired in Fall 2012 to teach part-time Utah and U.S. History at Sunset Jr. High, the Jr. High I attended as a Jr. High student. I taught one year part-time and was then offered a full-time position at the end of my first year. In July 2013 I went back to school to earn my Master's Degree in Education. I earned my Master's Degree in July 2014 from Concordia University, Portland. I have 3 wonderful children who are the highlight of my life. The 2022 school year will be my 10th year at Sunset Jr. High.</p>
            <p>I was asked to start teaching a Coding class at the Jr. High. After taking several classes and attending several conferences I found an amazing curriculum created by Apple called "Everyone Can Code." In August 2020 I started to work on another Bachelor's Degree at Western Governors University. This time I am working on earning a degree in Computer Science. In the Sprint of 2017, I started coaching the Girls and Boys Golf Teams at Northridge High and have loved every minute of it. I also have a second job that I started in October 2019 at the Apple Store at Farmington Station.</p>
            <p>Life is busy but I love every minute of it!</p>
