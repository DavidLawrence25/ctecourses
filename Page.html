              We cover 5 standards in this class the first being Intrapersonal Relationships focusing on goals, friendships, self-esteem and family relationships.
              Then we do child care and focus on seven points of danger and babysitter safety, third we do sewing and learn the part of the machine and basic equipment. We sew a small drawstring bag. Next comes the Foods unit and we go over how to read a recipe and nutrition, we have the opportunity to do a couple labs in the Foods room. Lastly we cover Interior Design and go over the Principles and Elements of design.

            <p style="font-size:24px; text-align:right;">
              We spend the first term of the class reviewing sewing skills and make 3-4 different projects depending on the time and skill of students. The second term of the class we spend on Interior design and go into depth on each of the Principles and Elements of design. The final project is to design a room using a computer program.

              I was born and raised on a farm in Montana. I went to a small high school,
              then attended Ricks College and BYU. I started my teaching degree at Layton High School,
              then took time off to raise my family and returned to teaching at Sunset Jr. High and love it here.
