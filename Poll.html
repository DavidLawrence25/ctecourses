              Creative Coding is an exploration into programming on the hull. We learn loads of useful programming techniques,
              including how to debug and create efficient and effective loops. This course also digs slightly into the basics
              of computer science and a brief understanding of how our everyday electronics function.

              Exploring Computer Science 1 is a class made to introduce
              how a computer works on a low level and how to make a simple,
              but elegant website. In this course, you will be using HTML
              & CSS to build a beautiful backbone that will be made even
              more functional when one eventually learns Javascript.
              (note: javascript is not taught in this course)

              This course takes you through the SWIFT language via an engaging game. In the game, you guide a character through certain maze-like structures
              with your own code. This code can be as lengthy and complicated as you wish, introducing some very fascinating techniques.

            <p style="font-size:24px; text-align: right;">
              As a continuation of ECS2 - Coding 2, this will extend your knowledge of the subjects and techniques taught in your previous venture. The levels ingame will be a little trickier to navigate than usual, 
              and the loops may take a bit more thought. At the end of this course, you should be capable of solving complex programming challenges one might face in the real world.

            <p>In 2012 I graduated from Weber State University with a Bachelor's Degree in History and Spanish Teaching. I was hired in Fall 2012 to teach part-time Utah and U.S. History at Sunset Jr. High, the Jr. High I attended as a Jr. High student. I taught one year part-time and was then offered a full-time position at the end of my first year. In July 2013 I went back to school to earn my Master's Degree in Education. I earned my Master's Degree in July 2014 from Concordia University, Portland. I have 3 wonderful children who are the highlight of my life. The 2022 school year will be my 10th year at Sunset Jr. High.</p>
            <p>I was asked to start teaching a Coding class at the Jr. High. After taking several classes and attending several conferences I found an amazing curriculum created by Apple called "Everyone Can Code." In August 2020 I started to work on another Bachelor's Degree at Western Governors University. This time I am working on earning a degree in Computer Science. In the Sprint of 2017, I started coaching the Girls and Boys Golf Teams at Northridge High and have loved every minute of it. I also have a second job that I started in October 2019 at the Apple Store at Farmington Station.</p>
            <p>Life is busy but I love every minute of it!</p>
